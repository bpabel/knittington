Disk image manager for Brother Electroknit KH-940 knitting machine.

This program is capable of reading and writing:
* 80k disk image files (our proprietary format)
* Steve Conklin's Tandy PDD1 floppy drive emulator data folders.

sample/           Samples of disk images
  1.img           Three small designs (actual data from machine)
  2.img           Two wide/tall designs (actual data from machine)
  3.img           Seven very different designs (generated file)
doc/              File format documentation
  mem_format.txt  Description of the KH-940 memory layout
  img_format.txt  Description of the disk image formats
  raw_format.txt  Description of pattern file format
patterns/         Sample patterns as both bmp and raw

== HOW TO USE ========================================================

Compile and launch knit executable.

Typing ? or help will give

  ?/help      show this
  r/read      read in data from file
  w/write     write out data to file
  f/format    clear all tracks
  t/track     set working track
  a/add       add pattern to track
  s/show      display content of track
  i/info      additional track info
  e/emulate   emulate floppy
  q/quit      end program
  x/halt      halt on errors


read - Reads image on disk to memory
  The file can be either disk image or folder with emulator files.

  Entering the name of a file will read it as a disk image, ie:
    filename> sample/1.img

  Entering a folder name, ending with a (back)slash, will read
  Tandy FDD1 emulator file folder, ie:
    filename> fddemu/img/
    
    
write - Write memory to image on disk
  The file can be either disk image or folder with emulator files.
  See "read" command for more info.


format - Clear computer ram contents
  This will delete everything currently contained in memory and
  ready the program for input of a new file.


track - Set working track
  The machine can store patterns in two separate tracks and this
  is chosen when saving/loading from the machine.
  
  This will sets the current working track for add, show and
  info commands.
  
  Tracks are entered as a number between 1 and 2, ie:
    track #> 1
  
  
add - Add a pattern to memory
  The pattern is read from a raw image file, ie:
    filename> patterns/903.raw

  See doc\raw_format.txt for a description of the format.
  
  
show - Show patterns contained in memory
  This will list all available patterns and to into pattern
  display mode. In this mode you get the following promt:
  
    pattern #>
    
  instead of the regular one.
  
  To exit this mode enter d, done or simply enter a blank line.
  
  While in this mode, enter the pattern number of an available
  pattern to print out a graphical representation of the
  pattern as well as it's binary data representation.


info - Shows additional non-pattern information
  This will display all important fields in the currently
  loaded file and run a verification suite against all of
  the know values.
  
  Verifications are done against the most common and verified
  to work values that have been downloaded from the machine.
  
  Therefore it MAY give FAIL on "write pointer" entries and/or
  the "loaded head" entry for some files because the machine
  sometimes inserts a 0x00 byte between patterns which causes
  a mismatch of 1 for these values. Exactly when/why this is
  done is uncertain, but it is not needed when writing patterns,
  so it may actually be a bug in the machine.
  
  Additionally, MOST parameters WILL give FAIL on a blank
  formatted file, regardless if done via device or this
  program.
  
  For a file generated using this program all parameters
  should give OK before attempting download.
  

emulate - Start floppy emulator
  
  This will ask for a serial device and the format is different
  depending on your system. For linux-flavors, it will usually
  look like:
  serial device> /dev/ttyS0
  
  For windows, it will look something like:
  serial device> COM1
  
  After entering a serial device, the program will go into 
  floppy emulation mode.
  
  You can exit this mode by sending a SIGINT, which is usually
  Ctrl+C on most systems.
  
  While in this mode, you can use the knitting machine to save
  or load data into program memory, which can first be build
  using add or read using read.
  
  After saving from the machine you can keep it with write.
  
  
quit - Self explanatory
  Go outside and enjoy the weather
  
halt - Enable/disable halt on errors
  Enabling halt on errors is good for command line execution
  
== BATCH EXECUTION ===================================================

All commands can be executed from command line, for example:

knit x a ptn/blocks.raw a ptn/inca.raw a ptn/text.raw w out/img/ q

Will do the following:

* Enable halt on error
* Add ptn/blocks.raw as #901
* Add ptn/inca.raw as #902
* Add ptn/text.raw as #903
* Write python floppy emulator folder out/img/
* Quit

In addition commands can also be piped in, or typed manually in
succession at any prompt within the program.
